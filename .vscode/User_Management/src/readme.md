Front-end:

Create an HTML/CSS template for the user interface. Design the signup, login, and profile pages to capture the user information.
Use JavaScript to handle user interactions and form submissions. Validate user input before sending it to the backend.
Backend (Java with Spring Framework):

Set up a Java web application using Spring Boot. This will handle HTTP requests and responses.
Create models or entities in Java to represent the user data (first name, last name, etc.).
Implement controllers to handle HTTP requests from the front-end and perform necessary operations, such as user registration, login, and profile view.
Use Spring Security for user authentication and authorization. This will help secure the user data and protect sensitive endpoints.
MySQL Database:

Set up a MySQL database to store user information. Create a table to represent the user entity and its fields (first name, last name, etc.).
Use a Java database library like Hibernate to interact with the MySQL database. Map the Java entities to database tables.
User Registration:

Implement a user registration endpoint on the backend to receive user sign-up information from the front-end.
Hash the user password before storing it in the database for security.
User Login:

Implement a user login endpoint to handle user authentication. Validate the user credentials against the stored hashed password.
User Profile View:

Implement an endpoint to fetch user profile data from the database and send it back to the front-end.
Front-end & Backend Integration:

Use JavaScript to handle form submissions and AJAX requests to communicate with the backend API.
The front-end will send data to the backend for registration, login, and profile view, and the backend will respond with appropriate data or success/error messages.
