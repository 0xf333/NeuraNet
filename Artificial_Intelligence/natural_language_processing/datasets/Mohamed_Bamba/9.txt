Should Mo Bamba get more playing time versus the Grizzlies? With the window of success opening up for the Lakers, this may be the time for head coach Darvin Ham to integrate Mo Bamba into the lineup.
APRIL 17 • USATODAY.COM
Makes brief cameo Friday Bamba (ankle) logged six minutes off the bench in Friday's 121-107 win over the Suns, finishing with two points (1-3 FG, 0-1 3Pt), three rebounds and one block. Impact Los Angeles ran a three-center rotation Friday, with starter Anthony Davis taking on 34 minutes while Wenyen Gabriel (eight) and Bamba covered the remaining 14. Bamba checked into the game at the start of the second quarter for his first appearance since March 5, after he had been sidelined for the past month with an ankle injury. He looks to be third on the depth chart behind Davis and Gabriel for the time being and may not be a regular member of the rotation once the postseason arrives. APRIL 8 • ROTOWIRE

Ruled out Tuesday Bamba (ankle) will not play Tuesday against the Jazz, Jovan Buha of The Athletic reports. Impact Bamba was upgraded to doubtful before the Lakers ruled him out officially. Coach Darvin Ham said Bamba will be re-evaluated Wednesday, so it sounds like he's closing in on a return. His next chance to play will be Wednesday against the Clippers. APRIL 4 • ROTOWIRE

Lakers News: Mo Bamba May Miss Rest Of Regular Season With Injury LA’s new 3-and-D reserve center will miss some time.
MARCH 9 • STAR-TELEGRAM.COM
Out at least four weeks Bamba was diagnosed Thursday with a left high-ankle sprain and will be re-evaluated in approximately four weeks, Mike Trudell of Spectrum SportsNet reports. Impact Bamba's injury will almost certainly sideline him for the remainder of the regular season, as he'll likely require some ramp-up time to get himself ready for game action even if he's cleared to resume basketball activities at the end of the four-week period. Since arriving in Los Angeles in a trade-deadline deal with the Magic, Bamba had been an inconsistent member of head coach Darvin Ham's rotation. With Bamba now out for the foreseeable future, Wenyen Gabriel will have a clearer path to serving as the unquestioned top backup to Anthony Davis. MARCH 9 • ROTOWIRE

MARCH 6 • STAR-TELEGRAM.COM
Ruled out Tuesday Bamba (ankle) is out for Tuesday's matchup against the Grizzlies, Kyle Goon of The Orange County Register reports. Impact After exiting Saturday's contest early due to an ankle sprain, Bamba will officially be sidelined Tuesday. The likes of Wenyen Gabriel and Rui Hachimura emerge as candidates to receive more usage with Bamba out of the lineup. The Texas product's next chance to return to the floor comes Friday against the Raptors. MARCH 6 • ROTOWIRE

MARCH 5 • STAR-TELEGRAM.COM
Won't return Sunday Bamba (left ankle sprain) will not return to Sunday's game against the Warriors, Kendra Andrews of ESPN.com reports. Impact Bamba will end his evening with two rebounds and nothing else over two minutes, and for now, he should be considered questionable for Tuesday's game against the Grizzlies. If he needs to miss time, his minutes will be divvied up amongst Jarred Vanderbilt, Rui Hachimura and Wenyen Gabriel. MARCH 5 • ROTOWIRE
Draws first start with Lakers Bamba will join the first unit for Wednesday's game against the Thunder, Mike Trudell of Spectrum SportsNet reports. Impact Bamba had seen just seven total minutes across his last two games but will step into the starting lineup with Anthony Davis (foot) out. In his only other two appearances with the Lakers, Bamba averaged 7.0 points, 9.5 rebounds and 1.5 blocks across 19.0 minutes. the fantasy-point-per-minute monster should have plenty of opportunities to contribute Wednesday with D'Angelo Russell (ankle) and LeBron James (foot) also sidelined.

Lakers News: West Exec Weighs In On League-Wide Value Of Mo Bamba LA’s new center has impressed so far.
FEBRUARY 25 • STAR-TELEGRAM.COM
Records double-double Thursday Bamba supplied 10 points (2-5 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 4-6 FT), 13 rebounds and one assist over 22 minutes during Thursday's 124-111 win over Golden State. Impact Playing in just his second game as a Laker, Bamba put up one of his better performances of the season, notching his second double-double (and his first since mid-November). The big man did so by tying his season-high mark with 13 rebounds, and he just managed to hit double-figure scoring thanks to a pair of three-pointers and four free-throws. The blowout nature of Los Angeles' victory allowed Bamba to play nearly as many minutes (22) as Anthony Davis (26), so there's no reason for fantasy managers to rush to grab Bamba off the waiver wire at this point.

Secures six rebounds in return Bamba amassed four points (2-7 FG, 0-5 3Pt, 0-2 FT), six rebounds, three blocks and one assist across 16 minutes before fouling out of Wednesday's 120-102 victory over the Pelicans... Impact Bamba returned from a four-game suspension to make his Lakers debut Wednesday. He slotted in as the top backup to starting center Anthony Davis and wasn't particularly efficient during his time on the court, but he still tied for the second-highest rebound total on the team while also pacing the Lakers in blocks. Since he had been behind Wendell Carter and Moritz Wagner on the depth chart at center in Orlando, Bamba's rest-of-season outlook has improved with the move to the Lakers, but he'll still profile as little more than a deep-league option so long as Davis is available.

Remains suspended Monday Bamba (suspension) is out Monday against the Trail Blazers, Harrison Faigen of SBNation.com reports. Impact Bamba has missed four matchups since being suspended four games due to an on-court altercation that occurred in early February. However, he was inactive for a game after being traded from the Magic to the Lakers, so he'll need to sit out once more before making his team debut Wednesday against the Pelicans.
