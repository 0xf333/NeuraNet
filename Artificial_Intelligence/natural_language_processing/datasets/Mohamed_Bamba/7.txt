Rotowire
3 hrs ago
Bamba (ankle) has been ruled out for Game 1 against the Warriors on Tuesday according to Trevor Lane of Lakers Nation.Bamba has been used sparingly by the Lakers, so this may not impact their game plans for Tuesday night. Bamba is day-to-day and his next chance to play will be Game 2 on Thursday.

Rotowire
May 1, 2023
Bamba is questionable for Tuesday's Game 1 against Golden State due to left ankle soreness, Broderick Turner of the Los Angeles Times reports.Bamba appeared in only one contest during the Western Conference Quarterfinals against the Grizzlies, logging just nine minutes during Game 6. His availability for Tuesday will likely depend on how he feels during morning shootaround and pregame warmups.

Lakers' Mo Bamba: Makes brief cameo Friday
Rotowire
Apr 8, 2023
Bamba (ankle) logged six minutes off the bench in Friday's 121-107 win over the Suns, finishing with two points (1-3 FG, 0-1 3Pt), three rebounds and one block.Los Angeles ran a three-center rotation Friday, with starter Anthony Davis taking on 34 minutes while Wenyen Gabriel (eight) and Bamba covered the remaining 14. Bamba checked into the game at the start of the second quarter for his first appearance since March 5, after he had been sidelined for the past month with an ankle injury. He looks to be third on the depth chart behind Davis and Gabriel for the time being and may not be a regular member of the rotation once the postseason arrives.

Lakers' Mo Bamba: Deemed probable Wednesday
Rotowire
Apr 5, 2023
Bamba (ankle) is probable for Wednesday's game against the Clippers, Ryan Ward of LakersNation.com reports.Bamba has missed the last month due to an ankle injury, but he'll likely be able to return to action for Wednesday's matchup. Given the length of his absence, it wouldn't be surprising to see his playing time monitored if he's given the green light Wednesday.

Lakers' Mo Bamba: Upgraded to doubtful
Rotowire
Apr 4, 2023
Bamba (ankle) is now doubtful for Tuesday's game against the Jazz, Mike Trudell of Spectrum SportsNet reports.Bamba has been out since March 5 with an ankle sprain, so while he's still unlikely to play, it's an encouraging sign to see him listed as something other than out. If he remains sidelined, he'll have only three more chances to suit up before the regular season concludes, starting Wednesday versus the Clippers and ending with a rematch against Utah on Sunday.

Lakers' Mo Bamba: Out at least four weeks
Rotowire
Mar 9, 2023
Bamba was diagnosed Thursday with a left high-ankle sprain and will be re-evaluated in approximately four weeks, Mike Trudell of Spectrum SportsNet reports.Bamba's injury will almost certainly sideline him for the remainder of the regular season, as he'll likely require some ramp-up time to get himself ready for game action even if he's cleared to resume basketball activities at the end of the four-week period. Since arriving in Los Angeles in a trade-deadline deal with the Magic, Bamba had been an inconsistent member of head coach Darvin Ham's rotation. With Bamba now out for the foreseeable future, Wenyen Gabriel will have a clearer path to serving as the unquestioned top backup to Anthony Davis.

Bamba (ankle) is out for Tuesday's matchup against the Grizzlies, Kyle Goon of The Orange County Register reports.After exiting Saturday's contest early due to an ankle sprain, Bamba will officially be sidelined Tuesday. The likes of Wenyen Gabriel and Rui Hachimura emerge as candidates to receive more usage with Bamba out of the lineup. The Texas product's next chance to return to the floor comes Friday against the Raptors.

Lakers' Mo Bamba: Sprains ankle Sunday
Rotowire
Mar 5, 2023
Bamba won't return to Sunday's game against the Warriors due to a left ankle sprain, Kendra Andrews of ESPN.com reports.Bamba will finish the game with two rebounds and no other statistics over two minutes, and for now, he should be considered questionable for Tuesday's game against the Grizzlies. If Bamba needs to miss time, Wenyen Gabriel would likely step in as the backup center behind starter Anthony Davis.

Lakers' Mo Bamba: Draws first start with Lakers
Rotowire
Mar 2, 2023
Bamba will join the first unit for Wednesday's game against the Thunder, Mike Trudell of Spectrum SportsNet reports.Bamba had seen just seven total minutes across his last two games but will step into the starting lineup with Anthony Davis (foot) out. In his only other two appearances with the Lakers, Bamba averaged 7.0 points, 9.5 rebounds and 1.5 blocks across 19.0 minutes. The fantasy-point-per-minute monster should have plenty of opportunities to contribute Wednesday with D'Angelo Russell (ankle) and LeBron James (foot) also sidelined.

Lakers' Mo Bamba: Records double-double Thursday
Rotowire
Feb 24, 2023
Bamba supplied 10 points (2-5 FG, 2-4 3Pt, 4-6 FT), 13 rebounds and one assist over 22 minutes during Thursday's 124-111 win over Golden State.Playing in just his second game as a Laker, Bamba put up one of his better performances of the season, notching his second double-double (and his first since mid-November). The big man did so by tying his season-high mark with 13 rebounds, and he just managed to hit double-figure scoring thanks to a pair of three-pointers and four free-throws. The blowout nature of Los Angeles' victory allowed Bamba to play nearly as many minutes (22) as Anthony Davis (26), so there's no reason for fantasy managers to rush to grab Bamba off the waiver wire at this point.

Lakers' Mo Bamba: Secures six rebounds in return
Rotowire
Feb 16, 2023
Bamba amassed four points (2-7 FG, 0-5 3Pt, 0-2 FT), six rebounds, three blocks and one assist across 16 minutes before fouling out of Wednesday's 120-102 victory over the Pelicans.Bamba returned from a four-game suspension to make his Lakers debut Wednesday. He slotted in as the top backup to starting center Anthony Davis and wasn't particularly efficient during his time on the court, but he still tied for the second-highest rebound total on the team while also pacing the Lakers in blocks. Since he had been behind Wendell Carter and Moritz Wagner on the depth chart at center in Orlando, Bamba's rest-of-season outlook has improved with the move to the Lakers, but he'll still profile as little more than a deep-league option so long as Davis is available.

Lakers' Mo Bamba: Remains suspended Monday
Rotowire
Feb 13, 2023
Bamba (suspension) is out Monday against the Trail Blazers, Harrison Faigen of SBNation.com reports.Bamba has missed four matchups since being suspended four games due to an on-court altercation that occurred in early February. However, he was inactive for a game after being traded from the Magic to the Lakers, so he'll need to sit out once more before making his team debut Wednesday against the Pelicans.

Lakers' Mo Bamba: Headed to Lakers
Rotowire
Feb 9, 2023
The Lakers acquired Bamba (suspension) from the Magic on Thursday in exchange for Patrick Beverley, a second-round pick and cash, Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN reports.Bamba averaged 7.3 points, 4.6 rebounds, 1.1 assists and 1.0 blocks in 17.0 minutes across 40 games for the Magic this season. With the move to Los Angeles, he'll likely slot in as the primary backup to starting center Anthony Davis, though he may have to fend off Wenyen Gabriel and Jarred Vanderbilt for those duties. Prior to the trade, Bamba served the first two games of the four-game suspension he received for his on-court altercation with the Timberwolves' Austin Rivers on Feb. 3. He'll thus sit out the Lakers' games Thursday against Milwaukee and Saturday at Golden State before he's eligible to debut with his new team Feb. 13 in Portland.
