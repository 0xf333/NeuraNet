The 2023 Concacaf Champions League officially kicks off on Tuesday, and there will be a new champion come the final this summer. Reigning champions the Seattle Sounders, one of the most consistent sides in Major League Soccer, failed to qualify for the competition and can only watch from afar. The winner of the competition doesn't automatically qualify for the next edition, unlike the UEFA Champions League. The teams from MLS in the cup are MLS Cup champs Los Angeles FC, followed by Philadelphia Union, Orlando City SC and Austin FC. The Mexican teams are the favorites with Tigres, Leon, Pachuca and Atlas leading the waty. Round of 16 first legs are this week and the return legs are next week. Games on Fox Sports can be streamed via fuboTV (Try for free).Here's what to know:Concacaf Champions League bracket

Lionel Messi contract: PSG not expected to offer new deal, Argentine star to hit free-agent market, per report

Paris Saint-Germain are not planning to extend Lionel Messi's contract once it expires this summer as the Argentina legend is primed to hit free agency in search for another club, according to French publication L'Equipe on Tuesday. This development is one of the consequences of the past 48 hours, which saw PSG suffer a shock home defeat to Lorient in League 1 play followed by Messi taking an unauthorized trip to Saudi Arabia with his family as part of a promotional commercial agreement. As a result of failing to report to training on Monday, the club has fined and suspended Messi for two weeks, which makes him unavailable for league games at Troyes and against Ajaccio. Sign up for our new newsletter covering the beautiful game in all its glory, including updates three times a week, here.

FC Barcelona, Messi's former club, and MLS side Inter Miami CF have been linked with the 2022 World Cup winner as the relationship with the French club appears to have soured. Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal made a stunning €400-million-a-year offer for Messi to join the same league as Cristiano Ronaldo. And Messi, who is already a Saudi tourism ambassador, isn't the only high-profile veteran star being targeted by the pro league.
His trip to Saudi Arabia was received poorly by club leadership and Tuesday's report that his contract won't be extended at season's end has always felt like the end result with how things have gone since his dramatic arrival two seasons ago. At this stage, it feels like more of a convenience for the parties to go their separate ways and start anew. PSG are five points ahead of Marseille with five games to go. Once the suspension is lifted in two weeks, Messi could return to a club that may have wrapped up the league title and will only have three games remaining on the season: at Auxerre (May 21), at Strasbourg (May 27) and at home against Clermont Foot (June 3).Listen below and follow House of Champions, a CBS Sports soccer podcast, covering everything you need to know about the beautiful game. Make sure to tune in for coverage of the biggest games, stories, transfer news with Fabrizio Romano, and everything else going on in the world's most popular sport.
Messi's contract expires at the end of June, making him a free agent for just the second time in his career. In 2021, he left Barcelona after the club could not afford his renewal due to their fledgling financial situation. As a result, he left the club he had been apart of since the age of 13 for PSG. He had an underwhelming first season in the French capital with 11 goals in 34 games, showing more production in this second season with 20 goals in 37 games. Similarly to Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, Messi's time at PSG has been marked by UEFA Champions League disappointment, as the trio failed to make it past the round of 16 the past two seasons.
