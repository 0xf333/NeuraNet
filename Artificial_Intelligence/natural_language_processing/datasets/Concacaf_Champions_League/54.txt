Hereâ€™s what you need to know:
A stoppage-time Kellyn Acosta equalizer gives LAFC all the momentum heading into leg two.
Daniel Gazdag scored Phillyâ€™s lone goal from the penalty spot in the 86th minute.
Leg two in Los Angeles is on Tuesday, May 2. Both teams have byes in MLS play this weekend and will be fresh. Reminder: Away goals are still the tiebreaker in CCL.
The Athleticâ€™s instant analysis:Philly unable to capitalize, LAFC takes controlThe Union dominated LAFC in the first half, controlling the state of the game and creating numerous big chances but were unable to finish and went into halftime 0-0. The second half was more balanced, but it was the Union who took the lead late on.AdvertisementPhilly got what they believed to be a game-winning goal in the 86th minute, but LAFC rallied for a huge equalizer by Acosta in the 91st minute. It was Acostaâ€™s handball that gave Philly their penalty.LAFC takes firm control of the tie, just needing a win at home or a scoreless draw to advance to the 2023 CCL final.
Notable performancesJose Martinez: The eccentric Union defensive midfielder played the hits on Wednesday night. Stellar in defensive transition, capable in possession, always getting stuck in, and, of course, pushing someone when the two teams were arguing. He came off in the 79th minute with an apparent injury, though. One to monitor for leg two.Kellyn Acosta: Acosta made up for his handball by popping up with an opportunistic goal in stoppage time.John McCarthy: Longtime MLS backup and Philly native John McCarthy was excellent against the Union again. He made numerous big saves, including a big stop on a Mikael Uhre breakaway, and was only beaten from the penalty spot. McCarthy came off the bench in MLS Cup 2022 for LAFC and won MLS Cup MVP. His Twitter banner is still in the Union Supportersâ€™ section.Daniel Gazdag: Gazdag has scored all 14 of his penalty attempts during the run of play for the Union. He has scored 19 of his 20 career penalty attempts.These two teams are peak MLSNo disrespect to the impressive starts of the Seattle Sounders, St. Louis City, FC Cincinnati or the New England Revolution this season, but for now, thereâ€™s a clear top tier in MLS at the moment and there are only two teams in the club. Those two teams are LAFC and the Union.LAFC have been better in MLS play to start 2023 and have seamlessly evolved their 2022 squad with numerous changes. Philly retained the overwhelming majority of their squad from last year, with the second-best goal difference in MLS history (plus-46).AdvertisementPhiladelphia Union have been the most consistent team in MLS over the last half-decade, while LAFC are the reigning MLS Cup/Supportersâ€™ Shield winners.This budding rivalry lives up to expectations in every match, too. Each of the last five times these teams met ended in draws (in regulation), with LAFC winning MLS Cup 2022 after penalties. These two teams finished level on regular season points, with LAFC winning the Supportersâ€™ Shield on a tiebreaker.Given the pedigree and talent of both teams, LAFC and Philly have the respect as MLS heavyweights.Onto leg two.Highlights of the match
