Concacaf Thursday announced details regarding the 2023 of the Concacaf Champions League.
The draw, which will determine each club’s path to the final and the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup (FCWC) is scheduled for Monday, Nov. 7 at 7 p.m. ET.
The 15th edition of the CCL includes the participation of 16 clubs from eight Concacaf associations, is scheduled to commence the second week of March.
Fans will be able to follow the draw and all four rounds of the competition through the confederation’s TV partner networks, including TUDN | ViX (USA-Spanish), Fox Sports Mexico (Mexico-Spanish), ESPN (Central America, Caribbean, and South America), and other local partners. For other territories, they will be available on the Official Concacaf App (all subject to territory restrictions).
Participating clubs
Fifteen of the 16 clubs that will participate in next year’s tournament have qualified through their domestic leagues and cup competitions, as well as the 2022 Concacaf League. The 16th participating club will be the 2022 MLS Cup champion. The MLS Cup is scheduled to be played on Nov. 5.
The list of competing clubs is available below and here (listed in alphabetical order per country):
Canada (1): Vancouver Whitecaps FC
Costa Rica (1): LD Alajuelense
El Salvador (1): Alianza FC
Haiti (1): Violette AC
Honduras (3): CD Olimpia, Motagua FC, RCD España
Mexico (4): Atlas FC, CF Pachuca, Club Leon, Tigres UANL
Panama (1): Tauro FC
United States (4): Los Angeles FC, Orlando City SC, Philadelphia Union, and the 2022 MLS Cup champions *
* If the 2022 MLS Cup champion is a Canadian club or a club that has already qualified for the 2023 CCL, then the slot will be awarded to Austin FC as the highest-ranked U.S.-based club not already qualified according to the 2022 MLS Supporters’ Shield standings.
Competition format and schedule windows
The CCL match-ups will start with the round of 16 in March, followed by the quarterfinals and first-leg semifinals in April, and the return-leg semifinals and first leg final in May. The return-leg final will take place Sunday, June 4.
Round of 16: March 7-9 (first legs) and March 14-16 (second legs)
Quarterfinals: April 4-6 (first legs) and April 11-13 (second legs)
Semifinals: April 25-27 (first legs) and May 2-4 (second legs)
Finals: May 31 (first leg) and June 4 (second leg)
For all rounds of the competition, the pairings will be determined by the competition’s bracket (available below) and the home club for the return leg of each series will be determined per round as follows:
Round of 16: Clubs from Pot 1 (highest ranked)
Quarterfinals: Clubs from the round of 16 matchups 1, 3, 5, and 7
Semifinals and final: Best performing clubs in the earlier rounds of the competition (based on wins, draws, and, if required, goal difference).
Draw procedures
Concacaf director of competitions Carlos Fernandez will conduct the draw alongside former players from the region.
The draw will be executed using a double-blind system and four pots. Pots 1 and 2 will contain the spheres with the names of the 16 participating clubs, and Pots A and B will contain the spheres with the bracket positions for the round of 16.
Based on the 2023 CCL Ranking (more information is available here), clubs will be distributed in Pots 1 and 2 as follows (in alphabetical order per pot):
Pot 1: Vancouver Whitecaps FC, Atlas FC, CF Pachuca, Club Leon, Los Angeles FC, Orlando City SC, Philadelphia Union, 2022 MLS Cup Champions
Pot 2: LD Alajuelense, Alianza FC, Violette AC, CD Olimpia, Motagua FC, RCD España, Tigres UANL, Tauro FC
The round of 16 bracket positions will be divided into Pots A and B as follows:
Pot A: A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7, A8
Pot B: B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8
The draw will begin by randomly selecting a sphere from Pot 2, followed by a sphere from Pot B to confirm the club’s round of 16 bracket position. The same process will apply for the remaining clubs in Pot 2, always drawing a club, followed by a bracket position from Pot B.
Once the eight clubs in Pot 2 have been assigned to a round of 16 bracket position, the first sphere from Pot 1 will be randomly drawn, followed by a bracket position sphere from Pot A. The same procedure will apply for all Pot 1 spheres.
At the end of the draw, each round of 16 matchup will feature one club from each pot and no more than one club from each country (per competition regulations, clubs from the same country cannot face each other in the round of 16).
New format for 2023-24
In September of 2021, Concacaf announced that from 2023-24 onwards, the Concacaf Champions League will be expanded to include 27 clubs and five rounds – Round 1, round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals and final.
Three regional cups (North America, Central America and Caribbean) will replace the Concacaf League and will qualify clubs to the expanded confederation-wide Champions League.
