FOXBOROUGH, Mass. – Concacaf has announced the schedule for the 2022 Scotiabank Concacaf Champions League (SCCL) Round of 16. The New England Revolution will open the two-legged Round of 16 with an away match against Cavaly AS on Tuesday, February 15 at 6:00 p.m. ET at a venue to be announced, before hosting the second leg at Gillette Stadium on Tuesday, February 22 at 6:00 p.m. ET.
The venues hosting each match will be announced by Concacaf in January. 2022 SCCL matches will be widely available for fans across the United States on FOX Sports (English) and TUDN (Spanish).
New England qualified for the 2022 SCCL as the Major League Soccer’s 2021 Supporters’ Shield winner. This marks the Revolution’s first time participating in international club competition since the 2010 North American SuperLiga and its first appearance in the Concacaf Champions League since 2008. New England also twice competed in the previous edition of the tournament in 2003 and 2006 when it was known as the Concacaf Champions’ Cup. The Revolution won a continental title by lifting the SuperLiga trophy in 2008.
Cavaly AS, one of three clubs making its SCCL debut in 2021 alongside Santos de Guápiles (CRC) and Forge FC (CAN), advanced to the Round of 16 after winning the 2021 Caribbean Club Championship over Surinamese club Inter Moengotapoe, 3-0. The Haitian side, one of 18 teams competing in Ligue Haïtienne, the country’s top competition, won its only league title back in 2007 and recently finished second in a shortened 2020 season.
If New England advances past Cavaly AS, it will face the winner of the Round of 16 matchup between Deportivo Saprissa (Costa Rica) and Pumas (Mexico) in the Quarterfinals. Each round of the 16-team tournament consists of a two-legged home-and-away series with the winner determined by aggregate goals over both legs. If aggregate goals are equal, the away goals rule is applied. If away goals are also equal, the game is decided in a penalty shootout. No extra time periods will be played except for the Final.
