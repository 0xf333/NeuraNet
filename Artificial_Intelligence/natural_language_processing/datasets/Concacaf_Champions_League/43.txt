March 7th, 2023 16:19 EST0Omar VegaA new season of the CONCACAF Champions League gets underway on Tuesday, as 16 teams battle it out to win a continental title that will bring with it a ticket to the next FIFA Club World Cup.Last year’s edition of the tournament ended with final victory for Seattle Sounders over Pumas - the first time an MLS side had ever won the trophy. Having qualified for this year’s Club World Cup in Morocco, Brian Schmetzer’s team suffered the disappointment of second-round elimination by Al Ahly.Can MLS claim back-to-back CONCACAF crowns?Nevertheless, the Sounders have set the bar high for MLS’ CONCACAF Champions League representatives this season, so Austin FC, Philadelphia Union, Orlando City, Vancouver Whitecaps and Los Angeles FC will be all out to secure a second title for the North American league. They know the road ahead won’t be easy, though.
Who are the favourites for the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League title?Although all 16 sides head into the tournament with the intention of lifting the title, the truth is that some have a better chance of doing so than others. According to bookmakers such as Caesars Sportsbook and BetMGM, the following teams are the top contenders.The outstanding candidate is Liga MX giants Tigres, who go into this year’s CONCACAF Champions League with the most valuable squad in the competition.One step below Tigres are LAFC, who arrive as champions of their domestic league - as do Pachuca, a side that have enjoyed good seasons in the Liga MX and are also one of the major contenders.Finally, other teams that stand out include Philadelphia Union and Atlas, who in recent months have done well in their respective leagues and dream of stealing the title ahead of the chief favourites mentioned above.
