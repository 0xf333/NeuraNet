Where to watch LAFC vs Philadelphia Union CONCACAF Champions League semifinal 2nd leg

An all-MLS semifinal on one half of the CONCACAF Champions League (CCL) bracket will see a winner determined on Tuesday as LAFC and the Philadelphia Union meet at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles for the second leg with the aggregate score level at 1-1. The team that advances will face Leon or Tigres of Mexico's Liga MX.
With a spot in the final on the line, it's all to play for in Los Angeles as the two sides drew last week in Philadelphia. It was a truly entertaining first leg, as the two clubs went blow for blow throughout the 90 minutes, and each scored a late goal to end all square at 1-1. Underpinning the thin margins between these two sides, they have produced five straight draws dating back to 2019.Nail Salon with Aliyah Boston and Zia Cooke | The Players’ TribuneNail Salon with Aliyah Boston and Zia Cooke | The Players’ TribunePauseNext video0:00 / 0:00VoltaxFull-screen

Away goals are still in play in the CCL, meaning Kellyn Acosta's first-leg equalizer for LAFC could be a potentially critical moment in this matchup. In fact, a scoreless draw here would see LAFC through to the final on away goals, while a high-scoring draw in LA (2-2, 3-3, etc.) would see the Union advance on the same away goals tiebreaker.
The two clubs met last year in the MLS Cup final and produced an epic match with LAFC triumphing on penalties, and it feels as though these two teams are the class of the American top-flight. Philadelphia will be eager for revenge after that heartbreaking cup final defeat, but the defending league champions are a force, especially at home.

LAFC vs Philadelphia Union lineups, team news
Both sides enjoy a notable clean bill of health coming into this match, but LAFC do have a few concerns to work around.
Goalkeeper Maxime Crepeau remains on the sideline with his broken leg suffered at the end of last season, although he's close to a return. His fellow shot-stopper Eldin Jakupovic is also missing, dealing with a leg issue.
LAFC projected starting lineup (4-3-3): McCarthy (GK) — Hollingshead, Murillo, Long, Palacios — Sanchez, Acosta, Cifuentes — Vela, Bouanga, Opoku.
The Union have almost no injury worries coming into this match, with only Olivier Mbaizo and Jose 'Brujo' Martinez struggling with hamstring problems. Martinez, who started the first leg and was injured in the process, could be replaced by Jack Elliott or Andres Perea in midfield.
While Daniel Gazdag has garnered the spotlight in front of goal, Alejandro Bedoya remains a key cog of this Philadelphia machine in midfield, and both will be crucial to any success the Union are to enjoy in this match.
Philadelphia Union projected starting lineup (4-3-1-2): Blake (GK) — Mbaizo, Glesnes, Lowe, Wagner — Bedoya, Elliott, McGlynn — Gazdag — Carranza, Uhre.
LAFC vs Philadelphia Union betting odds & lines
The hosts are big favourites in this match given their pedigree as defending MLS champions in addition to being the home side, but the odds are probably a bit out of whack for how evenly matched up these two teams are.
Having drawn in five straight matches against each other across all competitions, the Union proved their might in the first leg, only conceding on a very late Kellyn Acosta equalizer.
In this second leg, the teams are expected to go for the glory, and goals are expected according to the oddsmakers.
