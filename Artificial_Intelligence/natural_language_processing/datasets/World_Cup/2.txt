Previous international competitions
The world's first international football match was a challenge match played in Glasgow in 1872 between Scotland and England [7] The first international tournament for nations, the inaugural British Home Championship, took place in 1884 which included games between England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland [8] As football grew in popularity in other parts of the world at the start of the 20th century, it was held as a demonstration sport with no medals awarded at the 1900 and 1904 Summer Olympics (however, the International Olympic Committee has retroactively upgraded their status to official events), and at the 1906 Intercalated Games [9]
After FIFA was founded in 1904, it tried to arrange an international football tournament between nations outside the Olympic framework in Switzerland in 1906 These were very early days for international football, and the official history of FIFA describes the competition as having been a failure [10]
At the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, football became an official competition Planned by The Football Association (FA), England's football governing body, the event was for amateur players only and was regarded suspiciously as a show rather than a competition Great Britain (represented by the England national amateur football team) won the gold medals They repeated the feat at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm [11]
With the Olympic event continuing to be contested only between amateur teams, Sir Thomas Lipton organised the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy tournament in Turin in 1909 The Lipton tournament was a championship between individual clubs (not national teams) from different nations, each one of which represented an entire nation The competition is sometimes described as The First World Cup,[12] and featured the most prestigious professional club sides from Italy, Germany and Switzerland, but the FA of England refused to be associated with the competition and declined the offer to send a professional team Lipton invited West Auckland, an amateur side from County Durham, to represent England instead West Auckland won the tournament and returned in 1911 to successfully defend their title [13] Prior to the Lipton competition, from 1876 to 1904, games that were considered the "football world championship" were meetings between leading English and Scottish clubs, such as the 1895 game between Sunderland A F C and the Heart of Midlothian F C , which Sunderland won [14]
In 1914, FIFA agreed to recognise the Olympic tournament as a "world football championship for amateurs", and took responsibility for managing the event [15] This paved the way for the world's first intercontinental football competition for nations, at the 1920 Summer Olympics, contested by Egypt and 13 European teams, and won by Belgium [16] Uruguay won the next two Olympic football tournaments in 1924 and 1928 Those were also the first two open world championships, as 1924 was the start of FIFA's professional era, and is the reason why Uruguay is allowed to wear 4 stars [17][18]
World Cups before World War II
FIFA president Jules Rimet convinced the confederations to promote an international football tournament
Due to the success of the Olympic football tournaments, FIFA, with President Jules Rimet as the driving force, again started looking at staging its own international tournament outside of the Olympics On 28 May 1928, the FIFA Congress in Amsterdam decided to stage a world championship itself [19] With Uruguay now two-time official football world champions and to celebrate their centenary of independence in 1930, FIFA named Uruguay as the host country of the inaugural World Cup tournament [20]
The national associations of selected nations were invited to send a team, but the choice of Uruguay as a venue for the competition meant a long and costly trip across the Atlantic Ocean for European sides in the context of an economic crisis As such, no European country pledged to send a team until two months before the start of the competition Rimet eventually persuaded teams from Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia to make the trip [20] In total, 13 nations took part: seven from South America, four from Europe, and two from North America [21]
Estadio Centenario, the location of the first World Cup final in 1930 in Montevideo, Uruguay
The first two World Cup matches took place simultaneously on 13 July 1930, and were won by France and the US, who defeated Mexico 4–1 and Belgium 3–0 respectively The first goal in World Cup history was scored by Lucien Laurent of France [22] In the final, Uruguay defeated Argentina 4–2 in front of 93,000 people in Montevideo, and became the first nation to win the World Cup [23] After the creation of the World Cup, FIFA and the IOC disagreed over the status of amateur players, and so football was dropped from the 1932 Summer Olympics [24][25] After the IOC and FIFA worked out their differences, Olympic football returned at the 1936 Summer Olympics, but was now overshadowed by the more prestigious World Cup [24]
The issues facing the early World Cup tournaments were the difficulties of intercontinental travel, and war Few South American teams were willing to travel to Europe for the 1934 World Cup and all North and South American nations except Brazil and Cuba boycotted the 1938 tournament Brazil was the only South American team to compete in both The 1942 and 1946 competitions, which Germany and Brazil sought to host,[26] were cancelled due to World War II and its aftermath [27]
World Cups after World War II
The opening game of the Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, shortly before the 1950 FIFA World Cup
The 1950 World Cup, held in Brazil, was the first to include British football associations Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland withdrew from FIFA in 1920, partly out of unwillingness to play against the countries they had been at war with, and partly as a protest against foreign influence on football [28] The teams rejoined in 1946 following FIFA's invitation [29] The tournament also saw the return of 1930 champions Uruguay, who had boycotted the previous two World Cups Uruguay won the tournament again after defeating the host nation Brazil, in the match called "Maracanazo" (Portuguese: Maracanaço) [30]
In the tournaments between 1934 and 1978, 16 teams competed in each tournament, except in 1938, when Austria was absorbed into Germany after qualifying, leaving the tournament with 15 teams, and in 1950, when India, Scotland, and Turkey withdrew, leaving the tournament with 13 teams [31] Most of the participating nations were from Europe and South America, with a small minority from North America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania These teams were usually defeated easily by the European and South American teams Until 1982, the only teams from outside Europe and South America to advance out of the first round were: United States, semi-finalists in 1930; Cuba, quarter-finalists in 1938; North Korea, quarter-finalists in 1966; and Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1970 Expansion to 24 and 32 teams
Inside Soccer City in Johannesburg, South Africa, during a match at the 2010 FIFA World Cup
The tournament was expanded to 24 teams in 1982,[32] and then to 32 in 1998,[33] allowing more teams from Africa, Asia and North America to take part Since then, teams from these regions have enjoyed more success, with several having reached the quarter-finals: Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1986; Cameroon, quarter-finalists in 1990; South Korea, finishing in fourth place in 2002; Senegal, along with USA, both quarter-finalists in 2002; Ghana, quarter-finalists in 2010; Costa Rica, quarter-finalists in 2014; and Morocco, finishing in fourth place in 2022 European and South American teams continue to dominate, e g , the quarter-finalists in 1994, 1998, 2006 and 2018 were all from Europe or South America and so were the finalists of all tournaments so far Two hundred teams entered the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification rounds 198 nations attempted to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup A record 204 countries entered qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup the FIFA Presidency, at their meeting on 11 June 2015 at FIFA headquartersSepp Blatter and the Confederation)
