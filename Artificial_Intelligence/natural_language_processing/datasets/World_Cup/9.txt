previously, the women’s rights were bundled as an extra in the bidding for the men’s World Cup rights Acknowledging that playing the tournament in Australia and New Zealand might be a factor for broadcasters in Europe, Infantino nonetheless said the sums currently being offered for the tournament were a fraction of what FIFA considers their true value He noted that while viewing figures for the women’s tournament are between 50 percent and 60 percent of those for the men’s World Cup, the amounts offered for the women’s games have been much lower than that: In Europe alone, he said, they were “20 to 100 times lower than for the men’s FIFA World Cup ”“Whereas broadcasters pay $100-200 million for the men’s FIFA World Cup,” Infantino said, “they offer only $1-10 million for the FIFA Women’s World Cup This is a slap in the face of all the great FIFA Women’s World Cup players and indeed of all women worldwide ”There has been a substantial interest in women’s soccer in Britain, Europe’s biggest market, which peaked when England beat Germany to win the European championship on home soil last year That final was played in front of a packed Wembley Stadium and watched by more than 17 million on television, the highest audience for a televised women’s game in Britain The figure for the final represented 35 percent of the total global audience for the game, according to data from European soccer’s governing body The same data, though, highlights how certain women’s games in certain markets draw large audiences but highlights concerns among broadcasters over viewing figures for games not featuring premium teams in a tournament that will feature more games than ever According to news media reports, the BBC and ITV — the two main British broadcasters — have offered about 9 million pounds ($11 2 million) for the World Cup rights, the highest among European broadcasters The offer from Italy is about $1 million AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyThe inability of FIFA and broadcasters to reach rights agreements in the next two months does not necessarily mean the games will be unavailable to fans in Europe FIFA officials have previously spoken about possible alternatives, including airing the games on its own streaming platform or on FIFA’s YouTube channel Such a move would carry its own risks, however, both by reducing viewing figures and revenue for an event — and a sport — that FIFA has a stated commitment to grow AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite IndexSite Information Navigation© 2023 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsAccessibilityWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapCanadaInternationalHelpSubscriptions Support independent journalism See subscription options .
