New York Post•2 hours agoLeBron James didn't get single MVP vote for first time in his careerMore On: lebron james We found the cheapest Lakers-Warriors tickets. How much are they? NBA fines Grizzlies loudmouth for ducking media in Lakers series LeBron James appears to shade Grizzlies loudmouth after win series: 'Grown ass man' Grizzlies 'villain' skips out on media again after Lakers end their season There's a first time for everything, even when you're LeBron James and playing in your 20th NBA season. The Lakers star didn't receive any votes for the league's 2023 MVP award for the first time in his career as 76ers star Joel Embiid took home the hardware with 73 first-place votes and 915 points. Nikola Jokic, seeking an award three-peat, finished second with 15 first-place votes andRedlands Daily Facts•3 hours agoSoCal native Klay Thompson and dad Mychal relish Lakers vs. Warriors clashLife as the son of an NBA champion exposed Klay Thompson and his two brothers to experiences no regular kids get. As children they shook hands with Michael Jordan, chopped it up with Shaquille O'Neal at his locker and got up shots alongside Kobe Bryant warming up at Staples Center. In an NBA career that took Mychal Thompson from Portland's Rose Garden with Clyde Drexler to Los Angeles with Magic Johnson and, after his retirement, alongside the Trail Blazers and Lakers as a radio commentator, it was his goal to make arenas like home and teammates like family for his three boys.NBC Sports BayArea•3 hours agoExciting Warriors-Lakers NBA playoff series 'dream' matchup for Joe LacobWarriors owner Joe Lacob is excited for his team's "dream" matchup with the Los Angeles Lakers.USA TODAY Sports•1 hour agoVP Kamala Harris, Doug Emhoff make friendly wager on Warriors-Lakers series: 'Game on'There's a rivalry brewing between Vice President Kamala Harris and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff as the Warriors and Lakers face off in NBA playoffs.MercuryNews.com•3 hours agoNBA playoffs live updates: Warriors, Steph kick off series vs. Lakers, LeBronTo view the live updates on your mobile device click here .

PRIOR PLAYOFF HISTORY : Lakers have won 5-of-6 postseason series, including the last one in 1991. Ever since Steve Kerr joined the Warriors' core of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green as head coach, they've faced 11 of the other 14 Western Conference foes and vanquished them all. Some multiple times. But forSporting News•5 hours agoLeBron James' case for status as the NBA's GOAT keeps piling higher as the years advanceA couple of days before the 2015 NBA Finals began with an overtime classic that tilted a fascinating six-game Warriors-Cavaliers series in favor of Golden State, I wrote that I'd seen enough, as political analyst Dave Wasserman tweets so many times as election results are being calculated. My call: LeBron James had surpassed Michael Jordan as the greatest basketball player of all time. LeBron essentially has had another Hall of Fame career just in the seasons since.The Gazette (Colorado Springs, Colo.)•32 minutes agoBEST BETS: The Denver Gazette's best picks for today (Tuesday, May 2)May 2—Every day the Denver Gazette sports staff will publish its best bets: 1. Lakers (+4.5, -110) at Warriors: Rested and ready, Lakers must steal Game 1 or 2 by the Bay. 2. Lakers at Warriors (Under 227.5 points): Each team closed out its previous series with two straight Unders. 3. Heat at Knicks (-6.5, -110): Expect a spirited New York squad at Madison Square Garden. (Paul Klee's Best Bets ...Silver Screen and Roll•5 hours agoOne executive thinks 'literally every team in the league' will want Austin Reaves in free agencyEvery step of the way through his first two seasons in the league, Austin Reaves has met the moment. Whether as an undrafted rookie, a role player off the bench, a starter or a young player in his first playoff series, Reaves has found success time and time again. Reaves is set for restricted free agency this summer. Austin Reaves wants to be a Laker.Daily Jefferson County UnionAP source: Grizzlies have no plans to bring back BrooksThe Memphis Grizzlies have no plans to bring Dillon Brooks back to the team when he hits free agency this summer, a person with knowledge of the situation said Tuesday. The Grizzlies have since decided that he won't be in their future plans, said the person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither the team nor Brooks released details publicly. The Athletic first reported the Grizzlies' decision, and it was subsequently confirmed by ESPN. The NBA fined Brooks on Sunday $25,000 for not talking to the media after some of Memphis' losses in its first-round playoff series against the Los Angeles Lakers.Killeen Daily HeraldMike Bianchi: Steph Curry, not LeBron James, is the G.O.A.T of today's NBAIt is the consensus opinion among NBA experts that LeBron James is the greatest all-time active player, but isn't it time we started to change this robotic, uncreative, pre-programmed groupthink? Not only is there a discussion and debate to be had, but I'll even take it a step further and tell you today that I believe Steph Curry should go down as the greatest player in today's NBA. This statement is not meant to denigrate LeBron's status, but to decorate Steph's. In fact, before I make my case that Steph is actually greater than LeBron, let us pause for a moment to appreciate and acknowledge; to relish and revere these two NBA icons going head to head in the conference semifinals. The matchup between LeBron's L.A. Lakers and Steph's Golden State Warriors, which began Tuesday night in the Bay Area, speaks to the health and vitality of today's NBA.
