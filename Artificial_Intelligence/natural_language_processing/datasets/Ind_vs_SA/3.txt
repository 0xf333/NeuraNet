They want me to deal with that form in the following way:

Hide all the “Interest checkbox” elements without checking/unchecking them
If the Interest checkbox associated to one or more of the Address details (‘Office’ or ‘Home’) is already checked then transport the confirmed options to the Application form which will be submitted to Login site for further actions. A Rest web service will be called to check the above information and give a response based on the status of the input details. If confirmed, the Options[ Interest (Office or Home) + Confirm My Choices] next to Interest checkbox is enabled. If false then the Options[ Interest (Office or Home) + Confirm My Choices] next to Interest checkbox is disabled
Now in that situation, how would I ensure all the ‘Interest Checkboxes’ should be already checked/unchecked before passing the information to the application this?

I’ll have to hide all the “Interest checkboxes” elements but it doesn’t say anything about them being checked or unchecked.


A:

Here's the problem & solution, but I'm not sure which question you're more interested in . . . .
First of all, you have implemented many negative <code>if in</code> conditions, e.g. <code>if SelectedBox in Address), ('Office'), ('Home'):</code> That condition seems to be testing, "is SelectedBox <code>in</code> that list of two possible values?" Maybe what you want was actually to test, "is SelectedBox <code>not in</code> that list of two possible values?" If so, then <code>if SelectedBox not in ('Office','Home'):</code> should do it instead. 
Now, that said, I'm not sure why you were returning <code>significantly different values here than you were with</code>('Office')<code>or</code>('Home')` [different values than you were returning with ('Office') or ('Home')]. Did you mean to do this? Your <code>if const_user_value == 'Office':</code> returns the string "is selected" and prints "ConfirmOptionsfor this Office Address" [they are the same!], but for <code>('Office')</code> you return "ConfirmOptionsfor Officefor this Office Address"
Why is it returning a different string for different actions in the same place? Normal action is to just make it always return the same string for the same action (from the same place).  If a function returns something other than a string, then the function you call has the same name as your function?
Furthermore, why is <code>return ConfirmOptionsfor Officefor this Office Address</code> returning "1"? Just because you put a <code>return</code> on that line doesn't mean it return value is anything other than "None" [which would be returned by default anyway]. To return a value it has to be assigned to a variable before you reach <code>return</code>. If it's returning "1", then "1" must appear on the same (earlier) line of code, unless you're outputting it instead of return it.  And I'm not seeing a single place where "1" appears on a line of code with the world "return".
