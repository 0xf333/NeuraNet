The thought of not playing tennis again crossed my mind when I injured myself during the French Open: Djokovic

Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic says the thought of not being able to play tennis again crossed his mind after he injured himself during the French Open. Djokovic, who is currently the world No. 1, was playing his quarterfinal match against Pablo Carreno Busta when he hurt his shoulder while trying to play a backhand shot. The 33-year-old was clearly in pain and had to retire from the match, which he was leading 6-5, 1-0 at the time.

Speaking to reporters after the match, Djokovic said that he was worried about the injury and the thought of not being able to play tennis again did cross his mind.

"It was a really tough moment for me. I was worried about the injury and the thought of not playing tennis again did cross my mind. I was close to tears on the court," Djokovic said.

However, Djokovic said that he was relieved after he was told by the doctors that the injury was not serious and that he would be able to play again.

"I was relieved when the doctors told me that the injury was not serious and that I would be able to play again. I almost broke down after the match when I was talking to my team," Djokovic said.

Djokovic also said that he received messages from fellow tennis stars Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer after the match.

"It was nice to receive messages from Rafa and Roger after the match. They are both great champions and it means a lot to me," Djokovic said.

Djokovic will now turn his focus to the Wimbledon Championships, which is scheduled to begin on July 3.
