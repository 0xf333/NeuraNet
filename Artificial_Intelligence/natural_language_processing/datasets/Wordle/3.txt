How to play the Wordle Game Enter the first wordTo get started, simply enter any five-letter word to find out which letters match the hidden word In total, you will have 6 tries to guess the hidden word Find out what letters are in the hidden wordIf any letters are marked in yellow, this means that this letter is in the hidden word, but doesn't match the exact location in this word If any letter is marked in green, then it is in that word and is in the exact location If the letter remains gray, then it isn't in the hidden word Try to guess the hidden wordNow if you know a few letters with the exact location (green) and a few letters that are in the word (yellow) you can try to solve the hidden word and win the game Frequently Asked Questions
What are the rules of the Wordle game The main goal of the game is to guess the hidden word in 6 tries In each line, you need to enter any word from 4 to 11 letters to find out what letters are in the target word Depending on which word you entered, the letters will be highlighted in three colors Color marking:
The letter isn't in the target word at all The letter is in the word but in the wrong spot The letter is in the word and in the correct spot To win you need to completely guess the hidden word (all letters are
green) What is the best word to start the game At the beginning of the game, try to use a word without repeating letters and with as many vowels as possible, such as the word "RADIO" However, mathematician Grant Sanderson found that the best starting word is ‚ÄúCRANE" or ‚ÄúSLOTH‚Äù, which includes frequently used letters What dictionary are you using In American English, we use a dictionary from the Letterpress word list that includes a list of ~275,000 words This dictionary is constantly updated with new words based on real feedback from people Why did I get a "Word not found" message This alert message means that the given word was not found in our word bank Try another word, or if you think the word is correct, let us know The hidden word was incorrect Can you fix this If you think that the hidden word is wrong or incorrect, let us know We will definitely fix this as soon as possible How to change the entered letter If you want to change an incorrectly entered letter, just press the "Backspace" button, but remember that you cannot change the entered word How to download this game At the moment we don‚Äôt have applications in App store and Google Play (in development) But you can bookmark the site and play on PC or mobile devices right in your browser Can I guess a word to challenge my friends Certainly Just click on the icon (W+) in the top left corner, then guess any word from 4 to 11 letters (without spaces, hyphens, apostrophes) and click the "Copy Link" button If this word is found in our word bank, the link will be copied to the clipboard and then you can easily share it on social media Can I play in different languages We have developed many versions of the Wordle Game for different languages and dictionaries Now you can play in American English, UK English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Russian, Polish, Swedish, Irish, Czech, Greek, Turkish, Indonesian, and Filipino The game seems easy to me Can I make it harder You can make the game harder by turning on "Hard Mode" in the settings Then any revealed hints must be used in subsequent guesses Can kids play Wordle Wordle is suitable for all ages This game will be especially useful for children to develop memory and logical thinking skills We have developed a special edition for kids with a dictionary for children up to 8th grade, and the ability to select a target word from 3 letters to 11 letters Rate:

Your browser is outdated, we recommend updating it to the latest version or using another more modern one x ^\mu_{\text{HS}} \approx x^\mu - \sigma^\mu_{\phantom{\mu}\nu} $$

with $ \sigma^{\mu\nu} ={\ bigl(\frac{P^\mu P^\nu}{ P^2}- g^{\mu\nu}\bigr)} \frac{1}{2} \log
\bigg( \frac{P^2}{\mu^2} -1 \bigg)+{\frac{i P^{\mu\nu}}{ P^2}}$. These expressions have to be inserted into 
the $k \to \infty$ limit of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the hadronic states (\ref{eq:HSLipher})
and evaluated in the collinear frame. This gives a relation among the operators $J_\mu$. 
A first observations is that when the opposite limit $k \to 0$ is taken, 
the factor $f_\pm(k^*)$ vanish as $k^{*\mu}={\bigl(k_\mu + \frac{1}{2}\sigma_{\mu\nu}P^\nu\bigr)}e^{-iv(k)}\to 0$ and the 
rhs of the first of the equations in (\ref{eq:LH}) becomes zero. Thus, this equation tells us that in the $k\to 0$ limit
the amplitude  $A^\mu$ is proportional to $v^\mu=P a^\mu/P^2$ and, as shown in \cite{ close}, the light4-currents
satisfy the relation $P_\mu J^\mu=m^2a(k)$. This relation is equivalent to 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:almal}
a_\mu \cdot J^\mu=\frac{s}{\lambda(s,m^2,m^2)}, 
\end{equation} 

which proves that, indeed, the collinear expansion can be reorganized into a 
$\xi$ expansion using the rescaled currents, see Eq.(\ref{eq:rescurHAC}). 

Indeed, let us start with the amplitude $ A^{3,eq}_\mu$ in Eq. (\ref{eq:rescurHAC}), 
inserting the expressions in Eq. (\ref{eq:equiv}) and keep only the leading $k$ behaviour of 
the wavefunction and $A^\mu$ and sum over polarizations. One gets
