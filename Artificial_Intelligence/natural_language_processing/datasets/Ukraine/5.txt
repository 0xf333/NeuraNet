Manual of Accident and Emergency Radiology: featuring examination technique and clinical decision-making (Cambridge Medicine (Hardcover)*Manual ofAccident and Emergency Radiology is a practical guide to the radiographic assessment of acute injuries. Providing a comprehensive understandingof the role of radiography in the evaluation of the traumatized patient, the differing international approaches to imaging, and the pitfalls which can arise, itoffers clear, comprehensive guidance on the optimal use of radiography as well as radiological features of acute trauma.

Key features:

Provides a practical resource to critically assess how radiography can provide optimum patient care

Appeals to a wide international audience, outlining the differences and potential pitfalls in both approaches to imaging, radiographic technique and

ECR compliant

Focuses on accident and emergency radiology but with a cross over in approach to understanding and using different imaging modalities for trauma

radiology, for all radiologists, accident & emergency physicians and surgeons who use radiography to help determine a diagnosis and plan treatment after trauma.

The challenges of designing education and training after 2001 have concentrated the minds of many learning and ever since, educators have been striving to define what is required to meet the evolving challenges of a rapidly changing profession. Using a mix of design thinking methodologies; we developed integrative models, or what we call the Learner Future Model (LFM) to address academic challenges.

In this book we deliver broad global insights of how we created staff and student collaboration when designing courses. We brought students together in the learning design process and this produced an inspired community of students that provided valuable insights into the challenges of what could present in complex physically networked world.

This book covers the outcome of surveys and observations that we used to triangulate the findings of our research. In the same way our students were challenged to work collaboratively, we brought together a group of education experts to provide critical reviews of our work. This helped frame our work and provided a broad perspective of the challenges that have been met and lessons learned from the development and design of courses.

a range of perspectives on the purpose and principles of learning space design, in particular moves to support connected-collaborative learning.

‘Perspectives on Learning Space Creation’ does not deploy the grand language of educational theory, neither does its wordy planning proposals seek to replace sound educational theory. It presents the best of what a number of people have in many different situations tried doing to solve the question of how to design appropriate spaces for appropriate learning.’

E L Christopherson, Professor of Architectural Education, University of Strathclyde, UK

‘This book is both timely and current. It is a very coherent, brisk and straightforward read, both anecdotal and practical, and I think it is ground-breaking to tackle the topic of learning space design as a subject; I recommend it as a fundamental kernel that should be grasped by everyone who takes an interest in teaching and learning spaces.’
