Jos Buttler: I think the character we have shown since then (England's loss against Ireland) - it has been amazing We came here very excited, there was a very good feeling Everyone from 1 to 11 - stood up today We always want to start fast and aggressive Rashid was batting at 11, that's incredible to know that we have such depth Hales used the dimensions well and he has shown his form He was brilliant today It's important to enjoy this, it was a brilliant performance from us I think we need to give special credit to Jordan, to bowl 3 overs at the death coming into the semi-final, it was a tough job He handled the pressure towards the end pretty well, especially bowling against a world class player like Hardik Pandya Rohit Sharma: Pretty disappointed how it turned up today We batted well at the backend to get that score We were not upto the mark with the ball, we couldn't turn up today It's all about handling the pressure in knockout games All these guys have played enough to understand that These guys have played under pressure in IPL games, it's all about keeping calm We were nervy to start with, but you got to give credit to their openers, they played really well I thought it swung a bit in the first over, but not from the right areas We know the runs are scored square off the wicke, we were aware about it When we won the first game, it showed a lot of character The game against Bangladesh, it was a tricky one I thought it was difficult defending 85 runs in 9 overs, but we held our nerve and executed our plans Couldn't do that today, and when you don't execute your plans, you are in trouble Alex Hales | Player of the Match: It will be right up there for sure (referring to a perfect innings) Huge occasion, India in a semifinal of a World Cup, really happy with the way I played and it is as special as it gets This is one of the best grounds to bat in especially in the powerplay, a really good surface and great value for good cricket shots, this is a ground I have good memories of and enjoy batting here I never thought I would play in a World Cup again, so to get the chance is a very special feeling, in a country (Australia) that I love and spend a lot of time in, tonight is one of the best night's of my career Jos was unbelievable 21:35 Local Time, 11:05 GMT, 16:35 IST: What an authoritative performance from Buttler and Hales that Today, it was England all the way Kohli and Pandya gave India some respectability with their partnership, but Hales and Buttler were simply outstanding in reply Indian captain - Rohit Sharma struggled with the bat earlier in the day, and in the second innings - he was left clueless as a result of the pyrotechnics by the English openers Buttler hit three boundaries against Bhuvneshwar in the first over of the chase, and Hales multiplied India's problems with his breathtaking knock thereafter There was never a moment when the England openers looked troubled during the run chase as they finished things off in 16 overs If it was a clinical performance by Babar and Rizwan yesterday, the England openers have done an even better job So it's going to be the battle of the openers in the grand finale at the MCG Stay around for the presentations folks 15 6
