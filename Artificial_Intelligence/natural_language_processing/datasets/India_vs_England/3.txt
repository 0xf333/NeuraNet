The India cricket team toured England in July 2022 to play three One Day International (ODI) and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches against the England cricket team [1][2][3][4] In September 2021, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed that India would also play a one-off Test match, after the fifth Test in 2021 was cancelled [5] The following month, the ECB confirmed that the rescheduled match would determine the outcome of last summer's Test series,[6] and was played ahead of the T20I series [7]
In June 2022, following the conclusion of England's ODI series in the Netherlands, England's Eoin Morgan announced his retirement from international cricket [8] As a result, Jos Buttler was appointed as the new captain of England's white-ball teams [9] Adil Rashid was also made unavailable for the series in order to make the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca [10]
India won the first T20I match by 50 runs [11] India won the second T20I by 49 runs to win the series with a match to play [12] Despite a century from Suryakumar Yadav,[13] England won the third T20I by 17 runs, with India winning the series 2–1 [14]
In the first ODI match, England were bowled out for 110 runs inside 26 overs,[15] with Jasprit Bumrah taking the best bowling figures for India in an ODI in England [16] India went on to win by ten wickets,[17] the first time that India had recorded a ten-wicket victory against England in an ODI match [18] England last lost an ODI match by ten wickets in March 2011, when Sri Lanka beat them in the quarter-finals of the 2011 Cricket World Cup [19] England won the second ODI by 100 runs to level the series [20] Reece Topley took his first five-wicket haul and the best bowling figures for England in an ODI match with 6 wickets for 24 runs [21] India won the third and final match by five wickets to win the series 2–1, with Rishabh Pant scoring his first century in ODI cricket [22]
