carries A shot that will disappoint Gill He is not looking for a scoring shot but just pushing at a wide shortish ball Even if he middles it, he gets no runs for it As it turns out he edges it straight to second slip 27/117 6 to CA Pujara, no doubt about that one Crawley makes near-instant amends, and that's a snorter from Anderson, proud seam position, tight line, straightens and climbs at the outside-edge, and that kisses into edge, and a simple take in second slip's bread-basket 46/227 5 to SS Iyer, the short ball does it for Iyer Anderson, oh all the pace jokes you make about him, gets a specialist batter with a short ball This is short, seaming into the body, Iyer off his toes and fends at it, gets a tickle down the leg side, and Billings flies to his leg to take a one-handed catch 98/582 2 to RA Jadeja, bowled 'im Jadeja's work is done, he walks off to a standing ovation, and lots of back pats from his team-mates Took a big swing across the line at a length ball, and Anderson hits the top of middle 375/984 5 to Mohammed Siraj, swiped to mid-off, that's yer lot Anderson gets five, for the 32nd time in Tests, with Broad taking a good running catch over his head Siraj can't emulate his captain, but India will be very happy with their morning's work 416/10 Previous NextSee all photosStuart Broad1838914 94771221279 4 to Mohammed Shami, ramped straight to third England's cunning plan finally comes together Broad has his 550th Test wicket, celebrated with a certain amount of relief Short outside off, Shami gets a good connection on it, but Leach was stationed very fine and didn't have to move far to pouch the catch 371/8 Previous NextSee all photosMatthew Potts20110525 25821800122 2 to GH Vihari, there is the cleberappeal Looks quite adjacent This one seams in from a length, is not bouncing over and beats the inside edge to heat the knee roll Kohli advises against taking the review Not much you can do when it seams in from so full 64/324 2 to V Kohli, he has left it on to his wicket Looks to leave this alone but decides late to withdraw the bat It runs off the face of the bat to hit the stumps Potts is elated It is an outswinger that has swung late, which means he draws the bat away late 71/4 Previous NextSee all photosJack Leach907107 88268300Ben Stokes1304713 61604001067 6 to SN Thakur, and the eight-ball over does the trick A sharp bouncer surprises Thakur, tight into the gloves, Billings - with no slip - thrusts himself forward to scoop the looping chance and suddenly this game is shifting again 323/7See all photosJoe Root302317 6610310066 2 to RR Pant, gone this time Slower and wider, and he's edged to slip He wanted his 150 in a single hit, Stokes kept long-on and long-off up, and Root responded by tossing it slower and wider outside off It's a fat snick and a sharp take, albeit straight at slip, and that's the end of a breathless assault 320/6See all photosEngland 1st Innings BATTING RBM4s6sSRAlex Lees  b

touch with the angle Lees, it seems, was expecting it to hold its line and, therefore, ends up playing outside the line, leaving the gap between bat and pad That ball sneaks in through that, hitting Lees on the back leg before clattering into the stumps 16/14 1 to Z Crawley, Bumrah strikes again A full-length ball in the channel, Crawley goes for the drive but gets an outside edge and Gill takes a regulation catch at third slip Both England openers are back in the hut 27/210 6 to OJ Pope, and once again the extra ball fetches a wicket Full and wide outside off, Pope goes for the drive away from the body Gets a healthy outside edge that flies to Iyer's right at second slip It pops out but hits him on the chest and he pouches the rebound 44/3See all photosMohammed Shami2247823 541001201025 3 to MJ Leach, no mistake this time, Leach nicked off Superb line and he feels like he has to play, but can only divert a thin edge through to Pant, who gratefully swallows the chance Shami finally has a wicket his mastery deserves, and England are five down for less than 100 (and less than India were, too) 83/554 1 to JM Bairstow, what a bowling change You can give the assist for this wicket to Bumrah Shami pushes one up outside off, Bairstow, who had been tied up by Bumrah, sees a release shot, swings hard at it, gets a healthy edge, and Kohli takes a superb catch at first slip because this one is flying 241/7Mohammed Siraj11 326645 7342820022 6 to JE Root, gloved through Brute from Siraj, and Root is a goner Up goes the finger as Siraj tears off, his team-mates in pursuit Seaming back in and too close to cut, really, but the ball has also spat like fat from a fryer to graze glove, possibly top edge on its away through Made contact right by the splice, with Root limboing away, but unable to get out of the crosshairs Huge blow struck by India 78/455 4 to SCJ Broad, look away if you are a Stuart Broad fan This is soft He is just clearing the front leg and swinging If he was going to bat like this, he could have communicated to Billings to farm the strike Siraj bowls a bouncer, Broad is in no position but still has a swing at it, and he top-edges it for a catch to Pant 248/859 1 to SW Billings, and again Siraj's movement back in gets him a wicket This is short of a length, Billings is trying to run it fine, but the wobble-seam ball cuts back after pitching to take the inside edge onto the base of the leg stump 267/961 3 to MJ Potts, Iyer is claiming the catch but Potts is not walking Soft signal is out Over to the third umpire And it seems to have bounced in front of him Potts is making room, Siraj follows him, the edge is taken, but it dies in front of Iyer who is diving sideways for it In the end the soft signal works for India There;'s no way this is going to be given out if the soft signal is not out This is a little controversial I am not sure this ball didn't touch the turf The soft signal is all the difference here 284/10See all photosShardul Thakur704816 8528610737 4 to BA Stokes, Stokes, though, is adamant on giving India opportunities to redeem themselves Thakur and Bumrah, who have dropped him recently, both in action here Stokes has hit this hard trying to clear mid-off, but the mid-off is slightly back, and Bumrah dives at his left to take the catch huge wicket for India 149/6See all photosRavindra Jadeja20301

Vihari, lures him in Broad goes wide on the crease, pitches this up, Vihari feels he can drive it because of the angle, but Vihari's stride is not as big as, say, Kohli's, and he edges it to third slip 43/252 3 to CA Pujara, oh, cut straight to backward point Pujara has Bazballed himself Fine innings, but an uncharacteristic way to get out, and Broad is the man to benefit Strikes with his third ball of the morning, and England suddenly get a strong whiff of the chase in their nostrils once again 153/4See all photosMatthew Potts1735022 9477701059 2 to SS Iyer, picks out midwicket on the pull Tame way to go for Iyer, with England telegraphing their intentions and getting him with the short ball for the second time Potts bellows in relief, as Anderson holds a simple low catch Game's moving 190/569 1 to SN Thakur, After being smacked on the helmet, Thakur has fallen to the short ball the body. Pott goes straight after it as he looks to bowl it specific set
