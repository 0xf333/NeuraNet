######Reading CSV file 

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np


quint_quiz = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/My Drive/Quint_Dataset.csv')
quint_quiz


###Cleaning the data 

###Twitter dataset isn't a proper dataset. we need to create features from that data

##create features from the tweets based on the data

###1.Create features out of the user name by adding @symbol and removing twitter handles.

quint_quiz['screen_name'] = quint_quiz['screen_name'].str.replace(r"@\S+",'')

##remove the punctuation to have only simplequint_quiz['screen_name']

import string
quint_quiz['screen_name'] = quint_quiz['screen_name'].str.replace('['+string.punctuation+']', '')
quint_quiz['screen_name'] = quint_quiz['screen_name'].str.replace('', '')

##2.convert the tweet text to lowercase
quint_quiz['text'] = quint_quiz['text'].str.lower()

##3.Create as many single word features as possible

##refer to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26515844/create-new-columns-based-on-strings-in-two-other-columns

quint_quiz['text_words'] = quint_quiz['text'].str.split(' ')

###create features from the text_words column

features = []

for word in quint_quiz.text_words:
    if word != ['']:
        features.extend(word) #taking all the unique words

###remove duplicates

features = set(features)
len(features)

###removing blank spaces
quint_quiz1 = quint_quiz.drop(quint_quiz[quint_quiz.text_words == ['']].index)

##removing stopwords

#!pip3 install nltk
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
stop_words = {}.fromkeys(stopwords.words('english'))

def remove_stopwords(text):
  text_words=text.split()
  filtered_words = [x for x in text_words if x.lower() not in stop_words]
  return ' '.join(filtered_words)

quint_quiz1['text'] = quint_quiz1['text'].apply(lambda x : remove_stopwords(x))

##remove the punctuation to have only simplequint_quiz['screen_name']
quint_quiz1['text'] = quint_quiz1['text'].str.replace('['+string.punctuation+']', '')

###5.Tokenize the text_words column

###refer to https://machinelearningmastery.com/clean-text-machine-learning-python/

##we will now create a new dictionary and convert the feature values to binary representaion
tokenized_feature_dict={}
for feature in features:
  tokenized_feature_dict[feature]=[]
    
# Iterate over each text
for text in quint_quiz1.text_words:
    # Create a dictionary for the current text
    tokenized_text={}
    
    ##tokenize the words in the text_words and them as key in dictionary ; else 1
    tokenized_text = dict((token,token in text) for token in tokenized_feature_dict.keys())
    #print(tokenized_text)

    ##update the feature dictionary with new key value pairs generated after
    ##tokenization
    for key,arr in tokenized_feature_dict.items():
      arr.append(tokenized_text[key])

tokenized_feature_dict     


###target variable prediction
##  what is your take on the current situation in Kerala? and why? also,
##  can you name one person from each state who you think is doing something
##  impactful on a national level? Also,  Tweet


##create a binary variable
##0 for a tweet about the entire india
##1 for a tweet about a specific state
quint_quiz1['target'] = quint_quiz1['text'].apply(lambda x : 1 if x.startswith('RT') else 0)

##seperate the dataframe so that we can drop some features
index_val = quint_quiz1.index.tolist()
test = quint_quiz1[['retweet_count','favourites','screen_name','text','text_words','target']].iloc[index_val]
quint_quiz1 = quint_quiz1.drop('retweet_count',axis=1)
quint_quiz1 = quint_quiz1.drop('favourites',axis=1)
quint_quiz1 = quint_qu
