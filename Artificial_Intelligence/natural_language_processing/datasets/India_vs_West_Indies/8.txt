1 2 OUT CAUGHT Brilliant stuff from Chahar He has made giant strides since he toured the West Indies earlier Simmons has to make the long walk back to the pavilion Fullish delivery outside off, Simmons goes for the drive but finds the outside edge to Rohit Sharma at first slip Sharma there makes no mistake After a poor first over, India have broken through early 13/1

5 4 OUT LBW Sundar strikes The commentator's curse there A fullish length ball on middle, slower through the air Lewis gets in position to sweep but makes no connection as he plays the shot early The ball hits the pads Sundar and the keeper put in an appeal The umpire raises his finger instantly to send Lewis back He goes to King regarding the review but decides against it Looked touch and go there The replays roll in and it shows that it would've been umpire's call on impact and also hitting the wickets, so the DRS would not have helped 64/2

st Rishabh Pant b Ravindra Jadeja
10 1 OUT STUMPED King has to go back Poor shot There was no need of this shot These two were going well and this might just give the India the opening they need to get back in this game Jadeja, sees the batsman running down the track, drags his ball short King looks to heave the ball away but it goes past his bat Pant behind the stumps, pouches it and whips off the bails King was nowhere in the picture 101/3

c Shimron Hetmyer b Khary Pierre
3 2 OUT Caught Stunned silence here as the Hitman starts walking back The West Indies players are ecstatic Darted around the pads, Rohit dances down the track and looks to clear the man at deep mid-wicket He does not time it well and finds Shimron Hetmyer to perfection He almost spills it but manages to hold onto it Smart bowling this They had a plan for Sharma and they have executed it really well A big blow for India as Rohit has been a key batsmen for India, especially in big chases 30/1

16 2 OUT Caught Slower ball, 105 3 kph to be precise, a leg cutter from Cottrell Very full outside off, Pant tries to slog it He gets no timing it well It goes high in the air Holder comes running from long off and takes the skier with ease A good cameo from Pant comes to an end but many would feel he has once again failed to make the most of his chance Cottrell brings out his trademark salute Game on Or are India too far in front 178/3
