Queen Elizabeth II: Her Life and Reign
Queen Elizabeth II, who died September 8, 2022, at the age of 96, was the longest-serving monarch in British history While she was not in direct line for the throne at birth, she became heir apparent at the age of 10 when the abdication of King Edward VIII, her uncle, made her father the monarch A devotion to service—which began before she ascended the throne—was the hallmark of her reign As a teenager during WWII, she made radio broadcasts to boost the morale of the British public, and after turning 18, she joined the women’s branch of the British army, where she was trained to become an auto mechanic In a speech marking her 21st birthday Elizabeth said, "I declare before you that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service, and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong "
When Elizabeth II traveled the globe, although she did not make political pronouncements, her official presence at events had the force of diplomatic statements She participated in approximately 300 public events each year She held weekly meetings with prime ministers, fifteen during the course of her reign, beginning with Winston Churchill and ending with Liz Truss just two days before her death There were some light-hearted events, too, like the queen’s tea with Paddington Bear And she opened the 2012 Olympics with an elaborate video showing her being whisked away to a helicopter by Daniel Craig, portraying James Bond, where a stunt double dressed like Elizabeth parachuted into the opening ceremonies Queen Elizabeth II did not cut back on her appearances and duties until her final year, and then only on medical advice For her Silver Jubilee in 1977, she reflected on her early promise of service: "Although that vow was made in my salad days, when I was green in judgment, I do not regret nor retract one word of it ”
