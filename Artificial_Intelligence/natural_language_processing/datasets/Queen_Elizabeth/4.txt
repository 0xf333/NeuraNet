The modern monarchy Elizabeth II at the funeral for Princess DianaElizabeth II at NASA's Goddard Space Flight CenterThe queen seemed increasingly aware of the modern role of the monarchy, allowing, for example, the televising of the royal family’s domestic life in 1970 and condoning the formal dissolution of her sister’s marriage in 1978 In the 1990s, however, the royal family faced a number of challenges In 1992, a year that Elizabeth referred to as the royal family’s annus horribilis, Prince Charles and his wife, Diana, princess of Wales, separated, as did Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah, duchess of York Moreover, Anne divorced, and a fire gutted the royal residence of Windsor Castle In addition, as the country struggled with a recession, resentment over the royals’ lifestyle mounted, and in 1992 Elizabeth, although personally exempt, agreed to pay taxes on her private income The separation and later divorce (1996) of Charles and the immensely popular Diana further eroded support for the royal family, which was viewed by some as antiquated and unfeeling The criticism intensified following Diana’s death in 1997, especially after Elizabeth initially refused to allow the national flag to fly at half-staff over Buckingham Palace In line with her earlier attempts at modernizing the monarchy, the queen subsequently sought to present a less-stuffy and less-traditional image of the monarchy These attempts were met with mixed success British royal family in 2015Elizabeth II with U S Pres Barack ObamaDiscover how Camilla overcame controversy to become queen consortSee all videos for this articleElizabeth II and Catherine, duchess of CambridgeIn 2002 Elizabeth celebrated her 50th year on the throne As part of her “Golden Jubilee,” events were held throughout the Commonwealth, including several days of festivities in London The celebrations were somewhat diminished by the deaths of Elizabeth’s mother and sister early in the year Beginning in the latter part of the first decade of the 21st century, the public standing of the royal family rebounded, and even Charles’s 2005 marriage to Camilla Parker Bowles found much support among the British people In April 2011 Elizabeth led the family in celebrating the wedding of Prince William of Wales—the elder son of Charles and Diana—and Catherine Middleton The following month she surpassed George III to become the second longest-reigning monarch in British history, behind Victoria Also in May, Elizabeth made a historic trip to Ireland, becoming both the first British monarch to visit the Irish republic and the first to set foot in Ireland since 1911 In 2012 Elizabeth celebrated her “Diamond Jubilee,” marking 60 years on the throne On September 9, 2015, she surpassed Victoria’s record reign of 63 years and 216 days Elizabeth II at the funeral of Philip, duke of EdinburghElizabeth II and Prince PhilipIn August 2017 Prince Philip officially retired from public life, though he periodically appeared at official engagements after that In the meantime, Elizabeth began to reduce her own official engagements, passing some duties on to Prince Charles and other senior members of the royal family, though the pool of stand-ins shrank when Charles’s younger son, Prince Harry, duke of Sussex, and his wife, Meghan, duchess of Sussex, controversially chose to give up their royal roles in March 2020 During this period, public interest in the queen and the royal family grew as a result of the widespread popularity of The Crown, a Netflix television series about the Windsors that debuted in 2016 Having dealt with several physical setbacks in recent years, Philip, who had been Elizabeth’s husband for more than seven decades, died in April 2021 On their 50th wedding anniversary, in 1997, Elizabeth had said of Philip, “He has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years ” Because of social-distancing protocols brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the queen sat alone in a choir stall in St George’s Chapel (in Windsor Castle) at Philip’s funeral The widely disseminated images of her tragic isolation were heartbreaking but emblematic of the dignity and courage that she brought to her reign Elizabeth II and Liz TrussBritish royal family, 2022In June 2022 Britain celebrated Elizabeth’s 70 years on the throne with the “Platinum Jubilee,” a four-day national holiday that included the Trooping the Colour ceremony, a thanksgiving service at St Paul’s Cathedral, a  pop music concert at Buckingham Palace, and a pageant that employed street arts, theatre, music, circus, carnival, and costume to honour the queen’s reign Health issues limited Elizabeth’s involvement King Charles III”, a
