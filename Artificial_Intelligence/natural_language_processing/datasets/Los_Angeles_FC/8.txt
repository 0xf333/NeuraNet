Erik Duenas - Takes two shots in first MLS start Duenas took two shots and created a chance in Saturday's 1-1 draw against Nashville SC. He also made a block, two clearances, an interception and won three of four tackles in the m... Impact Duenas started his first ever MLS match on Saturday as he continues his way back from a torn ACL he suffered in August 2021. He will mostly be a depth option in LAFC's midfield this season, but -- just like seemingly every player at this club -- he is very talented and can make the most of each opportunity he gets on the pitch. 6 DAYS AGO • ROTOWIRE
Mateusz Bogusz - Takes three shots in first start Bogusz took three shots (one on target) and created two chances in Saturday's 1-1 draw against Nashville SC. Impact Bogusz made his first MLS start on the right wing against Nashville and it seems LAFC has yet another dangerous attacker in their squad. Of course Bogusz is behind the likes of Carlos Vela, Denis Bouanga, Kwadwo Opoku and Stipe Biuk in the depth chart. 6 DAYS AGO • ROTOWIRE
Jose Cifuentes - Takes four shots in draw Cifuentes took four shots (one on target) and created three chances in Saturday's 1-1 draw against Nashville SC. He also made a clearance, three interceptions and won two of two ta... Impact Cifuentes has started three consecutive MLS matches for LAFC, taking nine shots (one on target) and creating five chances in that span though he's still yet to get on the scoresheet this season. 6 DAYS AGO • ROTOWIRE
Denis Bouanga - Scores equalizer in draw Bouanga took six shots (four on goal), created two chances, and scored the equalizer in Saturday's 1-1 draw at Nashville. Impact Bouanga continues to pepper the goal, making it three consecutive games with six shots. He's up to seven goals on the season and doesn't look to be slowing down any time soon. Up next he'll look to add to his haul against in-state rival San Jose Earthquakes. APRIL 25 • ROTOWIRE
Stipe Biuk - Delivers first MLS assist Biuk took one shot and assisted on the equalizer in Saturday's 1-1 draw at Nashville. Impact Biuk delivered his first career Major League Soccer assist. He has one goal and one assist in four career starts, and he's proving to be a key depth piece in a crowded LAFC attack. He becomes fantasy relevant any time he's in the starting lineup, which the next opportunity for an appearance comes on Saturday, May 6 against California rival San Jose Earthquakes. APRIL 25 • ROTOWIRE
John McCarthy - Saves two in 1-1 draw McCarthy made two saves in Saturday's 1-1 draw at Nashville. Impact McCarthy helped LAFC maintain their status as the only remaining unbeaten MLS team in 2023. He has three clean sheets on the season, and he'll look to run that to four against in-state rival San Jose Earthquakes on Saturday, May 6. APRIL 25 • ROTOWIRE
Carlos Vela - Logs 20 minutes off the bench Vela took one shot and created one chance in Saturday's 1-1 draw at Nashville. Impact Vela was rested for the majority of the match, presumably so that he is ready to go for Wednesday's Concacaf Champion's League clash with Philadelphia. His next chance to contribute in league play comes in a California clash at San Jose on Saturday, May 6. APRIL 25 • ROTOWIRE
