LSU didn't make it out of the regionals in last year's NCAA gymnastics championships, but the Tigers entered this season ranked sixth in the nation and have lived up to their billing.
LSU is one of eight semifinalists in the event this year and has a chance to win a national championship in Fort Worth, Texas, this weekend.Nail Salon with Aliyah Boston and Zia Cooke | The Players’ TribuneNail Salon with Aliyah Boston and Zia Cooke | The Players’ TribunePauseNext video0:00 / 0:00VoltaxFull-screen

The Tigers have one of the nation's highest-profile gymnastics teams, but not entirely due to performance. Olivia Dunne is the most recognizable face on the roster thanks to her TikTok and social media fame. Her presence at LSU has helped raise the profiles of other Tigers gymnasts, but the program's national success has also played a huge role.
Now, LSU is looking to put it all together and claim its first-ever national title.

Here's a complete look at LSU's gymnastics roster as the Tigers compete for a championship.
LSU gymnastics roster
LSU's gymnastics roster contains 19 students this season. The Tigers' head coach is Jay Clark. Below is a full look at the roster:
Elena Arenas (Jr.)
Sierra Ballard (Jr.)
Annie Beard (Fr.)
Chase Brock (Jr.)
Haleigh Bryant (Jr.)
Ashley Cowan (Fr.)
Olivia Dunne (Jr.)
Aleah Finnegan (So.)
Cammy Hall (Graduate)
Alexis Jeffrey (So.)
Kiya Johnson (Sr.)
KJ Johnson (So.)
Lexi Nibbs (Sr.)
Maddie Rau (Sr.)
Kai Rivers (Sr.)
Kamryn Ryan (Sr.)
Alyona Shchennikova (Sr.)
Tori Tatum (So.)
Bryce Wilson (Fr.)
Bryant won the NCAA vault title as a freshman in 2021 and made headlines with three perfect 10s in LSU's final meet of the regular season in March.
Finnegan has won gold medals at the Southeast Asian Games and finished second with her floor routine at the SEC Championships this season.
Shchennikova earned the all-around championship at the 2017 U.S. Classic and has been a key part of LSU's success since 2020. She placed ninth in uneven bars at last year's NCAA championships.
Who is Olivia Dunne?
While there are plenty of talented gymnasts on LSU's roster, no one has the profile of Olivia Dunne. She's exploded on social media over the past few years, amassing 7.4 million followers (and counting) on TikTok.
Dunne has mastered the art of social media, gaining plenty of traction even before her time at LSU. While she started out posting gymnastics content, Dunne's posts now cover different areas of her life.

Dunne became internet famous in the right era. Thanks to the NCAA's name, image, and likeness (NIL) rules, she's been able to ink numerous sponsorship deals and become a millionaire before the age of 20. On3 listed Dunne's estimated NIL valuation at $3.2 million in March, making her one of the nation's highest-earning college athletes.
Dunne finished fifth on the uneven bars at the 2021 SEC Championships before placing ninth at the NCAA Championships. She finished 17th on the uneven bars at the 2022 SEC Championships and 28th in this year's edition.
Dunne missed most of this season due to multiple injuries, including a stress reaction in her leg.
Now finishing up her junior year, Dunne will try to elevate her platform even further by helping LSU win its first gymnastics national championship.
