For the second time in as many weeks, an LSU athletics program will be competing for a national title.
The Tigers earned the top spot of the NCAA Semifinal I on Thursday inside Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, Texas, and will advance to their ninth ever NCAA Championship alongside the Florida Gators, who finished second in the semifinal.

LSU and UF will be joined by Utah and Oklahoma, which advanced out of the other semifinal.
“I am just so proud of this team. They are such a special group. I just wanted to enjoy the ride and take it as far as we possibly could,” coach Jay Clark said in a release. “We’ve been riding the wave and going where it takes us. The adversity of this team has been spoken about so much and you saw the fight in them today. At the end of the meet, I just told them how in awe I am of them. I want them to enjoy these moments.”
The Tigers will look to win their first national championship in gymnastics on Saturday afternoon. In the meantime, here were the best photos from Thursday’s performance.
