Tiger Spotters Booster ClubThe Tiger Spotters Booster Club is a growing and enthusiastic group of LSU fans who lend their support to the upward movement that our program is experiencing. Many members lend their time and expertise to a large array of activities that include our team and fan base. Events such as tailgates (home and away), our annual awards gala, community appearances, and post meet activities are just a few examples of ways that our boosters get involved with our program. Additionally, all funds go directly to various enhancements and projects within the program. Items such as equipment upgrades, special apparel needs, post season events, locker room themes, and motivation video production are among the many examples of how Tiger Spotter funds are utilized to enhance the program.
