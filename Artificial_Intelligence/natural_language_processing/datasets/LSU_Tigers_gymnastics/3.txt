FORT WORTH, Texas — By all accounts, the LSU Tigers had no business being here.The injury-riddled team found a way, however, to muscle its way into the final four of the NCAA gymnastics championships at Dickies Arena in Fort Worth on Saturday.But in the final, the feisty Tigers ran out of magic. No. 6 LSU finished fourth after a solid but not extraordinary performance for a final score of 197.5250.

Haleigh Bryant of LSU put up the best all-around score Saturday with a 39.7250, but she did not win the individual national title, which was decided after the semifinals on Thursday.
“I can’t be more proud of a group of girls,” said Bryant, who finished second in the vault and tied for third in both floor and the bars. “We fought to the very end.
"It’s been a climb, we’ve been through so much adversity, but everybody gave everything they had for this team. I couldn’t ask for anything better and would not want to be anywhere else. I’m so honored to be a part of this program.”
The injury-plagued Tigers were without Kiya Johnson, KJ Johnson, Kai Rivers and Cammy Hall because of injuries on Saturday because of injuries.Reigning champion and No. 1 Oklahoma won the national championship with a team score of 198.3875. It’s the Sooners' fifth championship in the past six years, and 10th consecutive season finishing among the top two teams in the country.
No. 2 Florida finished second with 198.2375, and No. 5 Utah finished third at 197.9375.The Tigers were in fourth place entering the fourth and final event. LSU (148.0000) trailed Oklahoma (148.7125), Florida (148.5250) and Utah (148.2000). They needed a slew of high scores on the vault, their final event, to have a chance at a title.
Elena Arenas got the Tigers off to a great start with a 9.9000 on the vault. Alyona Shchennikova next scored 9.8250. Chase Brock and Bryce Wilson each scored 9.8875, and Aleah Finnegan recorded a 9.8625. Haleigh Bryant finished the event with a team-high 9.9875, but it wasn’t enough.
The Tigers were finished competing with a team-leading 197.5250, but they had to sit and watch the other three teams complete their final events.First, the Gators on the bars moved ahead of the Tigers. Then the Sooners on the floor jumped them both to move into first place and clinch the championship with six scores of 9.9 or higher.Finally, Utah edged ahead of LSU into third place on the beam.
“It is crazy. Nobody gave us a snowball’s chance in you-know-what to even be relevant at this point,” LSU coach Jay Clark said. “We utilized every single kid that we might not of thought otherwise would have competed a whole lot this year, and they stepped in and did an amazing job, and just kept overcoming.”
Clark called the Tigers’ season one of the two most rewarding in his 33-year career.
“I’m just very proud of this team,” he said. “There’s no hanging our heads about what this team accomplished this year. I know it wasn’t the outcome they wanted, but under the circumstances and everything they overcame … for them to advance here and reach the finals."We did much more than crawl, but sometimes you have to learn to crawl before you walk and you get to learn what it takes to really win this because this meet comes down to handstands and landings, and we didn’t land great on the first two events. And that could be the difference right there.”
Florida’s Trinity Thomas scored her 28th 10.0 score in NCAA gymnastics on the vault. That tied the NCAA career record of 10.0s held by UCLA’s Jamie Dantzscher and Kentucky’s Jenny Hansen.
Oklahoma started fast on the vault as four Sooners scored a 9.9 or higher.LSU started on the uneven bars with Bryant — who didn’t practice ahead of nationals because of a shoulder injury — sticking her landing to pull a team-high 9.95 score on the bars. Tori Tatum, Alexis Jeffrey, Ashley Cowan, Finnegan and Shchennikova all scored 9.8 or higher for a team total of 49.3125 on the bars.
The Tigers were in fourth place after the first rotation but only trailed first-place Oklahoma by fractions of a point.LSU remained in fourth place after the first two events. Finnegan led the Tigers with a beam score of 9.9250. Bryant scored 9.850, and Jeffrey and Sierra Ballard each scored 9.825. Shchennikova scored 9.8125, and Arenas scored 9.4750.Bryant scored a team-high 9.9375 on the floor, followed by Finnegan and Brock, who each posted 9.9250 scores.
Clark heaped praise on the junior Bryant.“So much was dependent on her and Aleah all year long,” he said. “If they weren’t completely dialed in, we would get in trouble.
"Haleigh is just incredible. I’ve run out of adjectives to describe her. She has a calming force on everybody around her. She’s an amazing athlete, but more than that, she’s just an incredible human being. And she loves her teammates with a depth that is not often seen by superstar athletes.
"She’s doing it for the right reasons. For her, it’s not about her accolades or NIL or anything else. She wants to do it for LSU and her teammates. She’s a special kid.”NCAA Championship final scores1. #1 Oklahoma 198.3875 (Vault — 49.5625, Bars — 49.6375, Beam — 49.5125, Floor — 49.675)
