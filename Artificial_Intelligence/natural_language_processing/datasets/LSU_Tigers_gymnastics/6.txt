The LSU Tigers women's gymnastics team [n 1] represents Louisiana State University in NCAA Division I women's gymnastics.[4] The team competes in the Southeastern Conference and is currently coached by Jay Clark, who is coaching in his fifth season.
The Pete Maravich Assembly Center serves as the home arena for the team.
History[edit]
The gymnastics program was founded in 1970. In 2008, LSU made their first Super Six appearance. The team also made Super Six appearances in 2009, 2013 and 2014. In both the 2016 and 2017 seasons, the program made the Super Six and finished second at the 2016 and 2017 NCAA Women's Gymnastics Championships.[5][6] Also in 2017, LSU won back-to-back SEC Regular Season and SEC Championship Meet championships.[7] In 2018, LSU again won back-to-back SEC Regular Season and SEC Championship Meet championships and reached the Super Six.[7]
In 2019, LSU won the SEC Championship Meet in New Orleans and made an appearance in the first-ever Four on the Floor in NCAA Women's Gymnastics Championship. The team finished second overall for the third time in school history.
In 2022, LSU placed fifth at the SEC Championships with a score of 196.725 despite entering the competition with the No. 2 seed.[8][9][10] No. 6 LSU placed third behind No. 11 Missouri and No. 22 Iowa in the first session of the semi-final of the Raleigh regional;[11] this eliminated them from the postseason, leading to an 18th-place finish nationally.[12]

Arena & facilities[edit]
Pete Maravich Assembly Center[edit]
Pete Maravich Assembly Center
Main article: Pete Maravich Assembly Center
The Pete Maravich Assembly Center is a 13,215-seat multi-purpose arena in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The arena opened in 1972 and is home of the LSU Tigers gymnastics team. It was originally known as the LSU Assembly Center, but was renamed in honor of Pete Maravich, a Tiger basketball legend, shortly after his death in 1988. The Maravich Center is known to locals as "The PMAC" or "The Palace that Pete Built," or by its more nationally known nickname, "The Deaf Dome," coined by Dick Vitale.[13]
The slightly oval building is located directly to the north of Tiger Stadium, and its bright-white roof can be seen in many telecasts of that stadium.
The arena concourse is divided into four quadrants: Pete Maravich Pass, The Walk of Champions, Heroes Hall and Midway of Memories. The quadrants highlight former LSU Tiger athletes, individual and team awards and memorabilia pertaining to the history of the LSU Tigers gymnastics team.[14]

Footnotes[edit]
^ LSU uses the nickname of "Lady Tigers" only in sports that have both men's and women's teams. Since LSU only sponsors gymnastics for women, that team uses "Tigers" instead.[3]

An Associated Press survey of all 65 schools from the five major conferences found that at least 28 had separate nicknames for men's and women's teams at some point in their histories. Only seven continue that practice, and in most cases they only have separate nicknames for certain women's teams. Texas Tech uses the Lady Raiders for women's teams in sports that also have men's teams: basketball, tennis, golf, track and cross country. LSU uses a similar strategy.
