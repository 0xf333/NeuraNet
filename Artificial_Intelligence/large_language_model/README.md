# AI Agents

# Ideas
- AI agent that generates a pointcloud, and then creates probabilities of things happening. It could be in the past or the future. 
For example, you could create probabilities that a certain crime happened in a certain way, 
after running through billions of possibilities. 
- Ultra fast AI agents, like thousands, millions, or billions per second. how can you increase python runtime that much. 
- AI agents that create merge requests on github on a 24/7 basis. read issues and fix them. Coukd be closely linked with banbury CLI.
