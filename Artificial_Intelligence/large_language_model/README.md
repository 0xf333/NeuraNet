# AI Agents

# Ideas
- AI agent that generates a pointcloud, and then creates probabilities of things happening. It could be in the past or the future. 
For example, you could create probabilities that a certain crime happened in a certain way, 
after running through billions of possibilities. 
- Ultra fast AI agents, like thousands, millions, or billions per second. how can you increase python runtime that much. 
- AI agents that create merge requests on github on a 24/7 basis. read issues and fix them. Coukd be closely linked with banbury CLI. 
- Continue with my vision to connect constantly model training to a decentralized file sharing system, primarily used
to share resources and allocate machine power optimally. 
- AI supercharged linux operating system. A conversation type mode and a mode for actually using the computer. Absolutely seamless. 
- AI agent that literally builds and improves itself by submitting merge requests. 
- Give an ai agent their own personal virtual desktop with their own github profile "Athena"
- You can write comments on the merge requests and Athena will add that to the queue to take a look at amd modify the way that you want.
