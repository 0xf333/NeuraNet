# AI Agents

# Ideas
- AI agent that generates a pointcloud, and then creates probabilities of things happening. It could be in the past or the future. 
For example, you could create probabilities that a certain crime happened in a certain way, 
after running through billions of possibilities. 
- Ultra fast AI agents, like thousands, millions, or billions per second. how can you increase python runtime that much. 
- AI agents that create merge requests on github on a 24/7 basis. read issues and fix them. Coukd be closely linked with banbury CLI. 
- Continue with my vision to connect constantly model training to a decentralized file sharing system, primarily used
to share resources and allocate machine power optimally. 
- AI supercharged linux operating system. A conversation type mode and a mode for actually using the computer. Absolutely seamless. 
- AI agent that literally builds and improves itself by submitting merge requests. 
- Give an ai agent their own personal virtual desktop with their own github profile "Athena"
- You can write comments on the merge requests and Athena will add that to the queue to take a look at amd modify the way that you want.
- I think there is also something to be explored with regards to the structrure of the "business." What I mean is that there is a lot
to learn with regards to the pros and cons related to having a horizontal vs vertical structure. A more vertical structure would require
more communication through middle management, and less creativity. Alternatively, a more horizontal structure would give everyone more
autonomy to do what they want, more creativity, and able to get things done faster. This is primarily due to the fact that there are
less channels to go through in order to ask a question. There is also a lot to be explored with having a structure that isn't tree based.
For example, google created a parent company, Alphabet, which I am pretty sure  contains a web like structure, where noone reports to
anyone, and ideas flow through the company as everyone are equals. How can concepts like this be applied to AI agents?
