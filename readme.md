# Overview
This is a project that I have been working on that combines the concepts of web 3.0 file services and machine learning. My overal idea is to create a machine learning algorithm that will save and fetch data through a decentralized file sharing network. 

## Features


## To-do
* search the web for particular topics
* learn to code
* demonstrate feelings
* automatically tamper with the michine learning model until it is able to achieve a certain level of accuracy (increase epochs, find more datasets, add more layers)
* train on openwebtext dataset: https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT/tree/master/data/openwebtext#:~:text=GPT%2D2%20paper-,OpenWebText,-dataset
# better web scraping capabilities: https://github.com/dragnet-org/dragnet
# general language model, not classification
