# Overview
This is a project that I have been working on that combines the concepts of web 3.0 file services and machine learning. My overal idea is to create a machine learning algorithm that will save and fetch data through a decentralized file sharing network. 

## Features
100% biometric log-in system
## To-do
* based on the prompt, create an itinerary of tasks that will be completed until the end goal is complete.
* search the web for particular topics
* learn to code
* demonstrate feelings
* automatically tamper with the michine learning model until it is able to achieve a certain level of accuracy (increase epochs, find more datasets, add more layers)
* train on openwebtext dataset: https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT/tree/master/data/openwebtext#:~:text=GPT%2D2%20paper-,OpenWebText,-dataset
* better web scraping capabilities: https://github.com/dragnet-org/dragnet
* general language model, not classification
* voice to text generator https://github.com/openai/whisper
* a voice for athena
* multiple voices for athena
* " What will the weather be like this week?"
* "can you add tennis with hillman at 6 pm on thursday to my google calendar
* " what time does cvs pharmacy close?
* if response comes with less than 25% confidence, get help from openai API
* determine whether or not a model is overfit or underfit and automatically manipulat the model/data accordingly
* commands to complete tasks on the computer
* Youtube TV
* store information about the user for future reference
