In this example, the web routes are defined using the HandleFunc method of a *mux.Router instance, which allows you to specify a handler function to handle requests to a particular route. The Methods method is used to specify the HTTP methods that are allowed for each route.

The web routes include routes for the home page (/), file upload page (/upload), file detail page (/file/{id}), account page (/account), login page (/login), signup page (/signup), and logout page (/logout).

The API routes are similarly defined using the HandleFunc method, but are prefixed with /api. The API routes include routes for getting a list of files (/api/files), getting a specific file (/api/file/{id}), uploading a file (/api/upload), logging in (/api/login), and signing up (/api/signup).

The http.ListenAndServe function is used to start the web server and listen for incoming requests on port 8080. Note that in a real production environment, you would likely want to use HTTPS and a different port number.
