## Issue bounties

We've tagged bounty-eligible issues across Athena and the rest of our repos; check out all the open ones [here](https://github.com/Banbury-inc/Athena/issues). Of course, it will take time to learn the Athena Ecosystem, but once you do, it should be smooth sailing and you should be able to complete things quickly. These bounties roughly work out like this:
* **$50** - a few hours of work for an experienced Athena developer; a good intro for someone new to Athena
* **$100** - a day of work for an experienced Athena developer
* **$500** - a few days of work for an experienced Athena developer
* **$1k+** - a week or two of work (could be less for the right person)
